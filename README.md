# julio-bootstrap-course
straight bootstrap course, personally I don't think I like bootstrap, I think I would rather use CSS and be really good at it, and there is a lot of faffing around with BS and more complications as well as it seems to create larger files sized, don't really see the need to use it if you know CSS really well, just does my head in.....lmao
